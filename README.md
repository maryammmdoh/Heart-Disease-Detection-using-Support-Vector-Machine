# Heart-Disease-Detection-using-Support-Vector-Machine
This project uses machine learning algorithms to detect heart disease in patients by analyzing their medical records and identifying patterns that indicate the presence of heart disease. The dataset used for this project contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them.
