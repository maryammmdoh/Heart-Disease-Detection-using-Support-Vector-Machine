# Heart-Disease-Detection-using-Support-Vector-Machine
Using machine learning algorithms, this project aims to detect heart disease in patients by analyzing their medical records and identifying patterns that indicate the presence of heart disease. The dataset used for this project is from Kaggle and contains 76 attributes, including the predicted attribute, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them1. The best model will be selected based on its accuracy and performance on the test data.
